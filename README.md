# Robust and efficient estimation of nonparametric GLMs
Functions implementing the density power divergence estimators of Claeskens G., Kalogridis, I., and Van Aelst, S (2022) "Robust and efficient estimation of nonparametric generalized linear models".
Implementation is with Fisher scoring and model selection is through the AIC.
