# Robust and efficient estimation for nonparametric GLMs
Density power divergence estimators for GLMs.
Functions implementing the density power divergence algorithms from Claeskens G., Kalogridis, I., and Van Aelst, S. "Robust and efficient estimation of nonparametric generalized linear models" (2022).
Implementation is with Fisher scoring and model selection is through the AIC.
